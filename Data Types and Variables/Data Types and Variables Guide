Introduction to Python Data Types
Today, we're going to dive into one of the most important concepts in Python: Data Types and Variables. Understanding how data is stored and manipulated in Python is the foundation of writing efficient programs. So, letâ€™s explore Python's built-in data types, variables and how they help us in codingðŸ’¡.

What are Data Types and Variables?
In Python, data types define the kind of value a variable can hold. A variable is just a name that refers to a value stored in memory. The type of data a variable stores is crucial because it determines what operations you can perform on it.

Here are some rules for naming a variable:

Character set: Variable names can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the underscore character, but the first character must be a letter or underscore.
Case sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive, so age, Age, and AGE are all different variables.
Reserved keywords: Avoid using Python's reserved keywords, like if, for, while, def, and class, as variable names. Using these keywords can cause syntax errors and unexpected behavior.
Spaces: Variable names cannot contain spaces.
Special characters: Variable names cannot contain special characters.
The Basic Python Data Types
Letâ€™s start with some basic data types in Python:

1. Numeric Types:
Python has three types of numeric data types:

int: Integer numbers (whole numbers), Example: x = 5
float: Floating-point numbers (decimals), Example: y = 3.14
complex: Complex numbers with real and imaginary parts, Example: z = 2 + 3j
Lets do practical:

a = 10      # int
b = 3.14    # float
c = 2 + 3j  # complex

print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'="">
print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'float'="">
print(type(c))  # Output: <class 'complex'="">
2. Boolean Values:
A boolean can only be one of two values: True or False. These are essential for logical operations and control flow (like if-else statements).

Example: is_raining = True

Example: is_sunny = False

is_adult = True
is_child = False

print(type(is_adult))  # Output: <class 'bool'="">
print(type(is_child))  # Output: <class 'bool'="">
Booleans are often the result of comparison or logical operations:

3. Strings:
Strings are sequences of characters surrounded by quotes. Python allows you to use single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or """).

For Example: 'Hello', "World", '''Python is fun'''

You can even include special characters like newline (\n) or tabs (\t).

# single and double quote
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, world!'

# multi line string is declared in tripple quote
multiline_string = '''This is
a multi-line
string.'''

print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'="">
print(type(greeting))  # Output: <class 'str'="">

1
What is the output of the following code?


Preview

class 'str'
class 'int'
class 'float'
class 'complex'

Correct!
Correct solution is float.

2
What is the data type of num = '10'?
Boolean
Float
Integer
String

Correct!

3
Which is the correct way of defining a string variable?
age = 10
string age = 10
age = TRUE
age = "Ten"

Correct!
Type Conversion/Type Casting
Type conversion refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Python provides two types of type conversion:

Implicit Type Conversion
Python automatically converts one data type to another when it is safe to do so. This process is known as implicit type conversion or type coercion.

x = 10  # int
y = 3.14  # float
result = x + y  # x is implicitly converted to float
print(result)  # Outputs: 13.14
print(type(result))  # Outputs: <class 'float'="">
Explicit Type Conversion
Explicit type conversion, also called type casting, is done manually by using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. Python provides built-in functions for this purpose. For example:

Convert integer to float
x = 5
y = float(x)  # y becomes 5.0
Convert float to integer:
z = int(3.14)  # z becomes 3
Convert to string
num = 42
text = str(num)  # text becomes '42'
Here float(), int(), and str() are used to convert data types, respectively. This process is known as type casting or explicit type conversion.
Checking Data Types
Python type() function allows you to check the data type of a variable.

greeting = "Hello"
greeting = 'Hello'
greeting = Hello
greeting = '''Hello'''

ISINSTANCE() Function
The isinstance() function in Python is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or a tuple of classes.

It returns True if the object is an instance of the specified class or any of its subclasses; otherwise, it returns False.

Syntax:

isinstance(object, classinfo)
Where:

object: The object you want to test.

classinfo: A class, type, or a tuple of classes and types to check against.

For Example:

x = 5
print(isinstance(x, int))  # Output: True
Let's do some activities to understand the concept better.

Error
False

Correct!

Differences between type() and isinstance() Functions
The isinstance() and type() functions in Python both check the type of an object, but they have important differences in their behavior and usage.

Here are some key differences between the two functions:

Return Values

isinstance(): Returns a boolean value (True or False)

type(): Returns the actual class/type of the object

For Example:

score = 42
print(isinstance(score, int))  # Output: True  
print(type(score)) # Output: class 'int'
Multiple Types Check

isinstance(): The isinstance() function can check if an object is an instance of multiple classes.

type(): The type() function can only check if an object is an instance of a single class.

Subclass Checking

isinstance(): The isinstance() function can check if an object is an instance of a class or any of its subclasses.

type(): The type() function can only check if an object is an instance of a specific class.

The isinstance() function is mostly used with data structures and classes, thus it will be explained in detail in the upcoming lessons.

14
What does the isinstance() function return?
An object type
None
A boolean (True or False)
An integer (0 or 1)

Correct!

15
What will be print(isinstance(str(42), str)) return?
False
Error
True
None

Correct!
