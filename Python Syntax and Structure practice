Indentation Rules
if True:
    print("This line is indented and belongs to the if block")
print("This line is not indented and runs after the if block")
Wrong Indentation:

It will give an error because the indentation is wrong.

if True:
print("This line is not indented and will cause an IndentationError")
Variables and Assignments
Dynamic Typing:

x = 10        # x is an integer
y = "Hello"   # y is a string
z = 3.14      # z is a float
Assignment in Python

x = 5           # Assigns the value 5 to x
name = "Alice"  # Assigns the string "Alice" to name
Multiple Assignments

a, b, c = 1, 2, 3    # a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
x = y = z = 0        # x, y, and z are all assigned the value 0
Swapping Variables

a, b = b, a
Reassigning Variables

x = 10       # Initially an integer
x = "Python" # Reassigned to a string
Global and Local Variables

x = 10  # Global variable

def example():
    y = 5  # Local variable
    print(y)

example()
print(x)
Special Cases

data = [1, 2, 3]
a, b, c = data  # a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
Activity 9. Name it Right!
 
User Input (input() function)
name = input("What is your name? ")
